git clone --branch=develop https://github.com/bellcom/seas-nve
cd seas-nve

Install [`composer`](https://getcomposer.org/) packages (you'll be asked for `database` and `mailer` settings during the installation):

```
SYMFONY_ENV=prod composer install --no-dev --optimize-autoloader
```

Install assets and update the database schema:

```
SYMFONY_ENV=prod app/console assets:install --symlink
SYMFONY_ENV=prod app/console cache:clear --no-warmup
SYMFONY_ENV=prod app/console cache:warmup
SYMFONY_ENV=prod app/console doctrine:migrations:migrate --no-interaction
```

```sh
SYMFONY_ENV=prod app/console aaplus:post-migrate
SYMFONY_ENV=prod app/console aaplus:post-migrate:20160711133430
```

Set file system permissions: https://symfony.com/doc/2.7/setup/file_permissions.html

Create a super administrator user:

## Known issues

After all installation steps it's possible you will get errors for some pages.

1. Configuration pages `/belysningtiltagdetail_nytarmatur` and `/belysningtiltagdetail_erstatningslyskilde` requires [`intl` php extension](https://www.php.net/manual/en/book.intl.php) on server.

2. General configuration page `/configuration`. Configuration entity has inconsistency in default values for keys `mtmFaellesomkostningerNulHvisArealMindreEnd` and `mtmFaellesomkostningerNulHvisTotalEntreprisesumMindreEnd`. You can update `Configuration` table manually and set these keys as nullable.

3. Create building page `/bygning/new` requires groups: `Aa+`, `RÃ¥dgiver`, `Interessent` in system. These groups are not created by default. You can add/(copy and rename) them in db (` fos_group` table) manually.

4. Project includes pdf converting process that based on [KnpSnappyBundle](https://github.com/KnpLabs/KnpSnappyBundle) component. It requires [wkhtmltopdf](https://wkhtmltopdf.org/)  `>= 0.12.2` tool to be install on server.

4.1 You may need to add you project host to `/etc/hosts`, to allow `wkhtmltopdf` tool resolves paths to images and sources from html content that going to be converted.

4.2 Allow system save temporary data to tmp folder. Check key `sys_temp_dir` and set it to accessible for webserver directory.
